# PowerBrackets

Power up brackets

Brackets is fast becoming a real contender for the most flexible and adaptable cross OS IDE available, and with power brackets it gets even better!

Inspired by [Web Essentials](http://vswebessentials.com/), a must have extension that completes the visual studio experience, Power Brackets brings a raft of power features to Brackets.

Power Brackets is still a work in progress,, but some of the current features include:

- LESS Compiler
- Minifier for Javascript, CSS, and HTML
- CoffeeScript Compiler
- Handlebars Compiler
- Markdown Compiler
- File tree and working view icons (thankyou [Font Awesome by Dave Gandy](http://fortawesome.github.io/)) - in progress
- New project command - in progress
